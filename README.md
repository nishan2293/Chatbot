# Chatbot Project 1: NLP Chatbot

## Project Overview

The objective is to create a chatbot using NLP techniques learned so far in class, excluding machine learning techniques. The chatbot aims to carry on a limited conversation within a specific domain by utilizing a knowledge base, web knowledge, and knowledge learned from user interactions.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main parts:

1. **Knowledge Base Creation:** Develop a custom web crawler to create a knowledge base (corpus) from a chosen topic. This involves scraping text from 15-25 relevant URLs and processing the text for NLP tasks.

2. **Chatbot Development:** Build a chatbot capable of discussing topics and remembering user details. The chatbot uses the created knowledge base and implements NLP techniques for conversation.

3. **Report and Evaluation:** Document the project's development process, including a description of the knowledge base creation, chatbot functionality, and an evaluation of the chatbot's performance.

### Part 1: Web Crawler Details

- Start with 1-3 URLs.
- Crawl to find 15-25 relevant URLs.
- Write functions for scraping, cleaning text, and extracting important terms.
