History
From East Investiture Controversy
The Western Empire division Verdun
The Holy Empire usually considered latest Otto I Great first German holder title Emperor
Although date beginning Holy Empire coronation Emperor typically used title king This title also make clearer Kingdom covered area included thus kernel country
Most historian therefore consider establishment Empire process split realm Treaty Verdun dynasty independently three section The eastern part fell German several leader death Child last eastern part
The leader I leader His successor Henry I Fowler acceptance separate Eastern Empire West still calling rex King East He dynasty
son Otto successor King A marriage alliance widowed queen gave Otto control nation well His later Emperor Otto I later Great would mark important step since Empire kingdom remainder kingdom would blessing Pope Otto much power Battle
In contemporary later writing would transfer Empire new Empire The German thus thought direct succession Empire initially Still call first probably order provoke conflict Emperor still The term imperator common later
At time eastern kingdom German confederation old Germanic tribe The Empire political union probably strong personal influence King Henry son Otto Although formally leader Germanic tribe actually able designate successor
This Henry without child first Dynasty king debate How exactly king chosen thus complicated conglomeration personal influence tribal quarrel inheritance acclamation leader would eventually become collegiate
Already time dualism territory old tribe rooted land apparent Each king preferred spend time homeland example spent much time palatinate around mountain among This practice Otto king Emperor utilize Empire temporary seat government Also successor Henry Henry apparently appoint duke territory It thus coincidence time terminology change first occurrence found
The glory Empire almost Investiture Controversy Pope declared ban King Henry king Emperor Although taken back Walk ban consequence Meanwhile German duke second king Henry could defeat war The mythical root Empire permanently German king Most importantly though church independent player political system Empire

Imperial right regalia since Investiture Controversy first time well This comprehensive list included public road tariff coining punitive fee investiture seating office holder These right explicitly rooted Law constitutional act north system also connected feudal law change visible withdrawal feud Henry Lion led public banning thus time closely bind stubborn Germanic duke Empire whole
Another important constitutional move establishment new peace Empire attempt one hand abolish private vendetta many local duke hand mean tie Emperor subordinate legal system jurisdiction public prosecution criminal act predecessor concept rule law modern term time yet universally accepted
In order solve problem emperor Investiture Controversy longer able use church mechanism maintain power increasingly lent land formerly unfree service men hoped would reliable local duke Initially used mainly war service new class people would form basis later knight another basis imperial power
Another new concept time systematic foundation new city emperor local duke These partly due explosion population also concentrate economic power strategic location formerly city shape either old foundation older bishopric century include possibly economic model many later city
The later reign last Emperor many way different Still child first second son Henry Lion son Otto title King After finally crowned emperor conflict pope power astonishingly many claim Crusade still pope ban

The difficulty king eventually led emergence fixed college elector whose composition procedure set forth Golden Bull This development probably best duality Kaiser emperor realm longer considered identical This also revealed way king sustain power Empire strength finance greatly Empire land always respective king included many Imperial After thirteenth century relevance faded even though part remain Empire end Instead increasingly local duke sometimes raise money Empire frequently reward faithful duty attempt civilize stubborn duke The direct governance longer need either king duke

Imperial reform
Map Empire showing division
The constitution Empire still largely unsettled beginning century Although procedure institution fixed example Golden Bull rule king elector duke Empire much personality respective king It therefore proved somewhat fatal king emperor king emperor old core land empire mostly land Without presence king old institution assembly realm leading men The legislative organ Empire exist yet Even worse duke often went feud often local war
At time church crisis The conflict several pope resolved Council much energy spent fighting heresy The medieval idea unified Corpus papacy Empire leading institution decline
With drastic change much discussion century Empire past longer adequately structure time reinforcement urgently During time concept reform original sense verb regain shape lost
When duke finance war time son later I king duke united demand participate Imperial Court For first time assembly elector duke Imperial Free later While conciliatory son finally father death Here king duke agreed four bill commonly Imperial Reform set legal act give Empire back structure Among act produced Imperial Circle Imperial Chamber Court structure would degree persist end Empire
However took decade new regulation universally accepted new court actually function would Imperial The King also made sure court continued function parallel It interesting note year Empire also received new title Nation Holy Empire German Nation
Crisis Reformation
In Martin would later known Reformation At time many local duke saw chance oppose hegemony Emperor The empire fatally divided along religious line North East many major Protestant southern western region largely Catholic Religious conflict waged various part century though German region relative quiet Peace Defenestration When emperor immediate result series conflict known Thirty War Empire Foreign power conflict fighting Imperial power also considerable chunk territory The long conflict Empire degree would never recover former strength
The long decline
part Holy Empire German Nation around Showing modern state border
The actual end empire came several step After Peace gave territory almost complete sovereignty even form independent alliance state Empire mere conglomeration largely independent state By rise Holy Empire lost power clout major politics The emperor role archduke emperor portion part Empire Throughout eighteenth century various conflict From onwards revolutionary war various part Empire intermittently The Empire formally August last Holy Emperor Emperor I following military defeat Army Napoleon Napoleon much empire Confederation Rhine This ended First family continued emperor In fact however nostalgically sentimentally considered lawful heir Holy monarch final continuation Holy Imperial line dynasty dying I would become one unified state War In addition time dissolution Empire following First World War Holy Empire supposedly still eye abstract level person Emperor despite formal dissolution longer bound independent monarchy consider legal successor Empire thus last independent state claim element continuity Holy Empire
Analysis
It said modern history primarily three factor Reformation later dualism Many attempt made explain never gain strong power territory opposed neighboring Some reason include
The federal body beginning opposed mostly part Empire eastern part kingdom Germanic tribe later German nation much independent reluctant cede power central authority All attempt make kingdom hereditary instead king always Later every candidate king make promise electorate election capitulation thus territory power century
Due religious connotation institution severely contest Pope German respective coronation Emperor It never entirely clear condition pope would crown emperor especially whether worldly power emperor dependent clerical power pope Much debate especially eleventh century eventually leading Investiture Controversy Concordat
Whether feudal system King formally top feudal pyramid cause symptom Empire weakness unclear In case military obedience according Germanic tradition closely tied giving land tributary always problem go war decision slow brittle
Until sixteenth century economic interest south west north League The League far closely allied rest
German historiography nowadays often view Holy Empire well balanced system multitude effectively independent state complex system legal regulation Smaller estate like Imperial Free city century independent entity although effective military strength The supreme court settle conflict least keep war word rather shooting war
The multitude different territory different religious denomination different form government led great variety cultural diversification felt even present day regional culture pattern behavior dialect sometimes within range
